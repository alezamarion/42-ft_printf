PRINTF | Stands for "print formatted"


from: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/format-specification-syntax-printf-and-wprintf-functions?view=msvc-160

take format string + optional arguments and
produce formatted sequence of characters for output

the format string contais zero or more directives wich are:
- literal characters for output
- encoded conversion specifications that describe how to format an argument in the output

conversion specificatons:
%[flags][width][.precision][size]type

Each field of the conversion specification is a character or a number that signifies a particular format option
or conversion specifier. The required "type" field specifies the kind of conversion to be applied to an argument. 
The optional "flags", "width", and "precision" fields control additional format aspects such as leading spaces or zeroes, 
justification, and displayed precision. The "size" field specifies the size of the argument consumed and converted.

only required: "type"  
- specifies kind of conversion to be applied to an argument, ex: %s or %c
    
    |*| We have to manage the following conversions: |*|
    c - Character:      specifies a single-byte character (char)
                        convert an int to an unsigned character and print the resulting character
    s - String:         specifies a single-byte or multi-byte character string; (char*)
                        s - print the string pointed to by a char *
    p - Pointer:    	Display the argument as an address in hexadecimal digits
                        p - print a void * argument in hexadecimal (ANSI C only)
    d - Integer:        Signed decimal integer
    i - Integer:    	Signed decimal integer
                        d or i - print an int as a signed decimal number
    u - Integer:    	Unsigned decimal integer
                        u - print an unsigned as an unsigned decimal number
    x - Integer:    	Unsigned hexadecimal integer; uses "abcdef"
    X - Integer:    	Unsigned hexadecimal integer; uses "ABCDEF"
                        x or X - print an unsigned as an unsigned hexadecimal number 
                        (where the letters abcdef are used with x and ABCDEF are used with X)
    %                   A '%' is written. No argument is converted.
                        % - print a single % character 
                       
    Note: if the argument that corresponds to %s is a null pointer, "(null)" is displayed.   

not required: 
- flags 
    The first optional field in a conversion specification contains flag directives, zero or more flag characters that specify output 
    justification and control output of signs, blanks, leading zeros, decimal points, and octal and hexadecimal prefixes. 
    More than one flag directive may appear in a conversion specification, and the flag characters can appear in any order.
    
    |*| We have to manage the following flags: |*|
    It will manage any combination of the following flags: ’-0.*’ and minimum fieldwidth with all conversions
    - (align)         Left align the result within the given field width.	Default is right align.
    0 (padding)       When the 'width' option is specified, prepends zeros for numeric types. (The default prepends spaces.)
                      For example, printf("%4X",3) produces    3, while printf("%04X",3) produces 0003.    
                      If width is prefixed by 0, leading zeros are added until the minimum width is reached. 
                      
                      If both 0 and - appear, the 0 is ignored. 
                      If 0 is specified for an integer format (i, u, x, X, o, d) and a precision specification is also present—for example, %04.d—the 0 is ignored. 
                      If 0 is specified for the a or A floating-point format, leading zeros are prepended to the mantissa, after the 0x or 0X prefix.
                      Default: no padding.
    . (precision)     It consists of a period (.) followed by a non-negative decimal integer that, depending on the conversion type, 
                      specifies the number of string characters, the number of decimal places, or the number of significant digits to be output.              
                      Unlike the width specification, the precision specification can cause either truncation of the output value or rounding of a 
                      floating-point value. 
                      How Precision Values Affect Type:
                        c - Character:      no effect
                        s - String:         specifies the maximum number of characters to be printed. Characters in excess of precision aren't printed. Default: Characters are printed until a null character is found.
                        p - Pointer:	    
                        d - Integer:        The precision specifies the minimum number of digits to be printed.     
                        i - Integer:    	If the number of digits in the argument is less than precision, 
                        u - Integer:    	the output value is padded on the left with zeros. 
                        x - Integer:    	The value isn't truncated when the number of digits 
                        X - Integer:    	exceeds precision. Default: precision is 1
    * (asterisck)     Can replace specifications of flags
                      For example, printf("%*d", 5, 10) will result in    10 being printed, with a total width of 5 characters.
                      It's same of printf("Teste: %5d  \n", 10);
                      For example, printf("%.*s", 3, "abcdef") will result in abc being printed.
                      It's same of printf("%.3s  \n", "abcdef");

from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printf_format_string

The string is written in a simple template language: characters are usually copied literally into the function's output, 
but format specifiers, which start with a % character, indicate the location and method to translate a piece of data (such as a number) to characters.

ex:
printf("Color %s, Number %d, Float %4.2f", "red", 123456, 3,14); -> Color Red, Number 123456, Float 3,14






Code:                                                               Output:

#include <stdio.h>

int main() 
{
    int number = 26;
    printf("Normal: Hello %i  \n", number);                         -> Normal:                  Hello 26  
    printf("Alinhado à esquerda (-): Hello %-i  \n", number);       -> Alinhado à esquerda (-): Hello 26
    printf("Padding normal: Hello %10i  \n", number);               -> Padding normal:          Hello         26
    printf("Asterisco: Hello %*i  \n", 10, number);                 -> Width:                   Hello         26  
    printf("Padding com zeros: Hello %010i  \n", number);           -> Padding com zeros:       Hello 0000000026

    char *str ="A galera da vila é fera";
    printf("String normal: %s  \n", str);                           -> String normal:           A galera da vila é fera
    printf("String com precision: %.8s  \n", str);                  -> String com precision:    A galera
    
    return 0;
}
